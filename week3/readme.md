What I struggled with the most this week was writing an interesting and funny story that made sense with the theme i wanted. When I think choose your own adventure, I think about undertale, a game that really really cares about choices. So heres my mini dating sim of a character I love FROM undertale. Yeah its a bit on the nose, but, hey, I think it makes sense. I am quite happy with the outcome though!
