I struggled a lot this week and came to where I am now at a stopping point. I am unsure how to make the other (bottom 4) images follow the same code as the top for without it bugging the entire code. Ive tried a lot and would love some feedback- are my arrays wrong?? What can possibly be happening here?? How do i fix it and make it functional?? Sorry this week was so lacking, I hope you can help with some ideas.
