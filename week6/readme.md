This week was hard, and i was also a bit late with the assignment so I felt i should really make a quality game, nothing like the broken mess I did for week 5. I had issues once the game was uploaded live, but it was completly functional up until then. I used chatGPT to get some help with bug fixes and also looked at the consol log, made some teeny adjustments, and now I think it's decent enough!
